# Botshowcase

**ABOUT THIS REPO**
This repo contains a few examples of code from bots I've made. I have not included full bots as they are sitll in use.
There is a lot of code, over 3k lines, however, I will only use a few that I like.

**USAGE OF CODE** 
Any usage of code here is strictly prohibited without my permission, as seen by the license found in this repo.

**LIST OF BOTS**
- BFO Bot
- Aviation Academy Bot
- S.A.R.A

**USAGE OF AI**
AI was used during the making of these bots, as part of final bug fixing and a bug scan to see anything I couldn't see. However, the actual code written was by me.
